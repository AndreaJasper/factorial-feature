# factorial-feature

## Project Outline
This project uses test-driven developement with Mocha to build a factorial method. This was achieved by following the red-green-refactor cycle:

- Red: write test to drive intended behavior.
- Green: write minimal implementation code to pass the tests
- Refactor: clean up of test and implementation code.

## What I learned
- How to use Mocha test framework
- Applying the red-green-refactor cycle
- Setup, exercise, and verification phases
- Use of Node.js assert to test expressions
